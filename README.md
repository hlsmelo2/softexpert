# SoftExpert

This project is my first test for the Soft Expert selection process

The objective of the project is to create some product registration screens and auxiliary data to be read later and compose a sale.

This sale must be saved, and on the sales screen, among other requirements, the values ​​of the products together with the quantities must be multiplied

The system also supports a login mechanism using JWT

The project was developed in vanilla PHP language and Javascript with the help of some libraries. Utilizes a built-in routing system that provides web routes and API routes
